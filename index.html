            <h2>Lore <i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i></h2>
            <p id="intro">Milo was no ordinary dog. Born in the tranquil village of Eldermoor, a place hidden deep in
                the enchanted forest, he was a small terrier with an unassuming stature, but a heart brimming with
                adventure. His story began when an ancient, magical oak tree in the village’s heart whispered his name
                in a vision to the village elder, predicting that a small dog would one day save their land from an
                impending darkness. At the time, no one took the prophecy seriously—after all, how could a tiny dog
                change the fate of a whole kingdom? But Milo was destined for greatness, though he didn’t yet know it.

                One fateful evening, the skies above Eldermoor darkened, and a creeping mist rolled over the land,
                signaling the arrival of an ancient curse. The village was soon overrun by shadowy beasts and monstrous
                creatures, sent forth by the malevolent sorceress Morgana, who sought to claim the forest’s magical
                heart for herself. With his village under threat, Milo’s true potential awakened. He discovered that his
                lineage traced back to the legendary Canis Luminis, a long-forgotten order of magical guardians who once
                protected the forest. His small size belied his newfound abilities: Milo could summon light to banish
                darkness, command the winds to carry him across great distances, and even communicate with the forest
                creatures who rallied to his side.

                Milo led a daring charge against Morgana’s forces, rallying an army of woodland creatures, from swift
                foxes to wise old owls, all eager to defend their home. In an epic battle under the glow of a full moon,
                Milo confronted Morgana herself. With a flash of blinding light and a bark that echoed through the
                trees, he shattered her dark spell, breaking the curse and restoring peace to the land. Though the
                villagers now hailed him as their hero, Milo remained humble, always content to chase after butterflies
                in the meadows and curl up beside the village hearth, knowing that his small paws had helped protect a
                great and magical world.</p>
