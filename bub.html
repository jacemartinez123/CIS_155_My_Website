            <p>Lore of Lil Bub:

                Lil Bub, the mystical kitten with eyes as wide as the full moon, is an unlikely but fierce ally to Milo
                in the battle against darkness. Born under a rare celestial event, she was destined to be a companion to
                the hero of Eldermoor. Unlike other cats, Lil Bub was blessed with a unique charm: the ability to
                harness the power of the stars themselves. Her small size and quirky demeanor often belied her strength,
                but those who underestimated her quickly learned the error of their ways. Raised in the secluded corners
                of the enchanted forest, Lil Bub was trained in the ancient ways of the Feline Astrals, a secret order
                of magical cats who could channel the energy of the heavens. Her powers, though unrefined at first, grew
                stronger with Milo’s guidance, and soon she became an invaluable part of the team, using her
                star-infused magic to aid in their adventures.

                <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i>
                <li>Celestial Barrier – By weaving threads of starlight, Lil Bub can create shimmering protective
                    barriers around her allies. These ethereal shields absorb incoming damage, providing defense against
                    physical and magical attacks. The barrier glows with the energy of the stars, shimmering brightly in
                    the darkest of places.</li>
                <li>Starflare Burst – Lil Bub can focus her celestial power into concentrated bursts of blinding light,
                    stunning and disorienting enemies. This explosive burst blinds foes temporarily, leaving them
                    vulnerable to further attacks while also disrupting dark magic, making it difficult for shadow-based
                    enemies to focus or aim.</li>
                <li>Astral Traverse – Lil Bub can temporarily shift into the astral plane, becoming a fleeting wisp of
                    starlight. This ability allows her to travel between the stars, evading danger, sneaking past
                    enemies, or quickly navigating across realms. It makes her an unpredictable and elusive force, able
                    to outmaneuver even the most powerful foes</li>
